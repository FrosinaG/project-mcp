		<h2>About us</h2>
		<p>Macro Print helps brands reach their target audience using innovative and extremely effective advertising strategies – changeable ad banners on truck trailers. We turn your trailer into moving advertising spaces that are visible from three sides, on every road and every city 24/7.
Due to the triple-secured system and easy handling of the banner feed, there is no faster advertising solution in this area.
This advertising option reaches more customers than handbills. With customized design and high-quality printing – our solution is a real eye-catcher. Trucks never stop neither will your advertising. We have been successfully operating internationally for years and in 2020 due to the strong demand from the North American market for trailer advertising, we founded Macro Print in the USA.

	<h3> Our System</h3>
	<p>Our System
Marco Print distributes an innovative tension frame system, developed in Austria– Europe.
Safety first! Through our patented solution, we offer a three-stage safety technology to make the product suitable for the roads. The system consists of the basic profiles – these are bonded to the trailer body using a tested and certified process and connected to the tensioning profiles, which fix the advertising banner securely and safely.
Our system allows favorable advertising space using double-sided printing that makes it flexible and cheap. Due to the flexible system, the advertising banner exchange can be easily carried out during a loading process.
We will be happy to convince you of our product. Watch the road, you will surely see us.</p>
